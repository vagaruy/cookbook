* Total Time: 50 mins

Ingredients:

* 1.2 lb Chicken thigh cut into a few pieces
* 0.5 Large Onion
* 2 Large Carrot
* 2 Small Potatoes
* 6 Radishes
* 14 Green Chile (Dry or Fresh)
* A bunch of cilantro
* Ginger Garlic Paste
* Turmeric
* Cumin Seeds
* Salt to taste

Directions:

1. Dice the onion like you would for sambar, make small pieces of carrot, potato and radishes.
2. If using fresh green chile then toast them slightly. Then chop them into small sizes (dry or fresh)
3. Cut the chicken thigh into a couple of big chunks. The pressure cooker will help with the shredding. Too small pieces will completely pulverize.
4. Use a little bit of oil to sautee cumin and then brown the onions and then add the rest of the vegetables in a pressure cooker. 
5. Once slightly browned, add the chicken to the mixture and add enough water to cover the veggies and make a stew. 
6. Now close the lid and once the pressure reaches, cook for another 15 minutes. Then turn off the flame and cook for another ten.
